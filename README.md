# p101-error-contract

`p101-error-contract` checks a small but important p101 convention: when a
function uses p101 wrappers, tracing, or p101 error macros, the function should
make its `env` and `err` contracts visible.

The normal path consumes native libclang records directly from `lib_c_facts`,
including exact function extents and caller identity, so it does not own a
private C parser or reconstruct function boundaries from line order. A
`P101FACT` snapshot remains available as an explicit offline input.

## Usage

```sh
p101-error-contract [-h] [-j] [-q] [-v] [-i <facts.tsv> | -C <compile_commands.json>] [path ...]
```

Examples:

```sh
p101-error-contract
p101-error-contract src include
p101-error-contract -C build-clang/compile_commands.json src
p101-error-contract -i source-facts.tsv src include
p101-error-contract -j src > error-contract.json
```

If no path is supplied, `src` is scanned.

## Findings

| ID | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `P101-ERR-001` | A p101 wrapper call or `P101_TRACE` appears before a visible `p101_env` / `env` contract in the current function. |
| `P101-ERR-002` | A fallible p101 wrapper call or p101 error macro appears before a visible `p101_error` / `err` contract in the current function. |
| `P101-ERR-003` | A fallible p101 wrapper passes `NULL` in the standard error-object position without documenting an intentional best-effort boundary. |
| `P101-ERR-004` | With `-S`, a second fallible p101 call is reachable on the same Clang statement path before the prior error state is checked or returned. |
| `P101-ERR-005` | A source file creates more `p101_error` objects than it destroys. |
| `P101-ERR-006` | A source file creates more `p101_env` objects than it destroys. |
| `P101-ERR-007` | A function other than `main` terminates the process instead of returning a status or raising through `p101_error`. |
| `P101-ERR-008` | A function contains more than one explicit exit point. |

Process termination is an application-boundary decision. Helpers, libraries,
and CLI parsers must return a status or raise an error so `main` retains
control of cleanup, reporting, and the final exit status. The sole mechanism
exception is `p101_tool_run_child_main`: it is the entry point of a freshly
forked child and must call `_exit` if `exec` fails, because returning would
resume the parent's workflow in the child.

Each function also converges on one exit point. Returning functions use one
final `return`; a `void` function may use its closing brace as the single
implicit return. `main` follows the same structure and makes one final process
status decision for the shell. This keeps cleanup, error reporting, and state
commit decisions in one visible place.

`P101-ERR-004` is intentionally strict. Enable it with `-S` when code must
preserve the first failure and stop before any later fallible side effect. The
default contract accepts the common p101 boundary style where an error object
remains set across a short sequence and is checked or returned at the boundary.

For a deliberately fallible boolean probe where failure *is* the result rather
than an error to report, place
`/* P101_ERROR_CONTRACT_ALLOW_NO_ERROR: reason */` immediately before the
probe. The exception applies only to a call on that line or the immediately
following line, and also admits an intentional `NULL` error argument. It is
visible to reviewers; do not use it to silence ordinary error propagation.

The checker accepts either a signature-level contract discovered from Clang AST
facts:

```c
static int load_file(const struct p101_env *env, struct p101_error *err, const char *path);
```

or a local contract that is created before the first relevant p101 call:

```c
struct p101_error *err = p101_error_create(false);
struct p101_env   *env = p101_env_create(err, NULL);
```

## Admitted inputs

The user gives source/header paths. With `-i`, the tool consumes that exact
P101FACT v4 snapshot and does not invoke Clang again. Otherwise, it invokes
`lib_c_facts` directly over the admitted translation units. If the current
project has a Clang build named by
`.last-build-dir`, or a `build-clang/compile_commands.json`, that database is
used automatically so sibling p101 include directories and project defines
are preserved. Use `-C` to select another compile database explicitly.

## Outputs

Text output is line-oriented:

```text
path/to/file.c:42: P101-ERR-002: fallible p101 call or error macro appears before a visible p101_error/err contract [function_name]
```

With `-j`, the tool emits JSON:

```json
{"schema":"p101-error-contract-findings-v2","findings":[],"summary":{"files_scanned":0,"findings":0}}
```

Each finding uses the common `id`, `severity`, `location`, `message`, and
`evidence` envelope.

## Blind spots

This checker is only as complete as the admitted translation units. If
libclang cannot parse one, or the wrong include flags or compile database are
used, analysis fails as tool trouble rather than silently reporting a partial
clean result. The contract judgment is still a teaching heuristic, not a proof
of all possible C control flow.

The flow check follows calls with the standard fallible wrapper contract
(`env, err, ...`), recognizes explicit error guards and returns, and keeps
branch-local state for conditionals, switches, and loops. A function return
propagates its existing `err` state; the tool does not guess whether a numeric
return value means success or failure. libclang's stable C API does not expose
Clang's complete compiler CFG, so goto edges, switch fallthrough, exceptional
C++ flow, and precise loop fixed points remain explicit blind spots.

The single-exit check counts explicit return statements and terminating calls.
It does not yet prove whether a `void` function with one conditional early
return can also fall through its closing brace; review that shape as two
control-flow exits even when only one `return` token exists.

Direct libc calls are outside this tool's job; use `p101-wrapper-audit` for
that. Third-party code is only checked if you ask this tool to scan it, and it
may not follow p101 conventions.

The ownership checks are deliberately file-scoped balance checks. They cannot
prove object identity or infer an undocumented ownership transfer through a
return value or output parameter. An intentional transfer should therefore be
made visible in the API and documented when reviewing the finding.

The `needs_env` and `needs_error` decisions come from the resolved callee
signature recorded by libclang. The discard check relies on the p101 API
convention that fallible wrappers take `env, err` as their first two arguments.
C acquisition and parsing belong to `lib_c_facts`; this tool owns only the
error-contract policy.

## Build and check

Configure a compiler once, then run the gate:

```sh
./change-compiler.sh -c clang
./check.sh --no-fuzz
```

```sh
cmake --build build-clang
